I'm a pink parrot with development skills. I've been developing for the past three years, working on various projects mostly in Java. I'm an epic **GAMER** spending his days playing competitive Minecraft and being on do not disturb on Discord. I've mostly worked on Minecraft related projects, most notably the server Endcraft and it's forks with [EerieDEV](https://eerie.ml).

I have experience with:
* HTML
* CSS
* JS
* Java
* Python
