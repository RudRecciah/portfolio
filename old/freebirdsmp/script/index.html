                Basically Rud's alt, playing as Neil, trapped you inside his machine to do some tests on you (including himself, playing as the Neil we know from TTM and FP). No one knows this really at all throughout the entire plot until the end. I wrote this at 12 AM. Thicky plays Colin, with Faye being Rud's alt that hides who he is. No one can see him other than Thicky. He ends up revealing himself at some other big plot point later on. Stealth plays Rob, and rivals Rud. Everyone else recording is just a random person put into this machine. Anyone else who isn't a main character has been in this simulation for much longer. The main characters are all new people, joining at the same time.

                This script isn't really something to follow perfectly, just try to stick close to it. I made it to be flexible.
